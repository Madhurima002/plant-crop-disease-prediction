# plant-crop-disease-prediction
Plant Crop Disease Prediction is an advanced application that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to accurately detect and diagnose plant diseases from images. The goal of this project is to provide farmers and agronomists with a reliable tool to identify plant diseases early, thereby improving crop yield and ensuring food security.

Features
Accurate Disease Detection: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning models for high-accuracy disease prediction.
Image Analysis: Processes images of plant leaves to identify disease symptoms.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing results.
Mobile Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly on mobile devices for on-the-go use.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for the application.
TensorFlow/Keras: Libraries used for building and training deep learning models.
OpenCV: Library for image processing.
Flask/Django: Web framework for developing the user interface and API.
MATLAB: Utilized for image processing techniques in some parts of the project.
Dataset
The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which includes a wide variety of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
